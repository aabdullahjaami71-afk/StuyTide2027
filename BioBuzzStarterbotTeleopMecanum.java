/*
 * Field-centric teleop for the goBILDA® StarterBot with Mecanum Wheels
 * (2026-2027 FIRST® Tech Challenge).
 *
 * Field-centric drive means "forward" on the left stick always moves the robot away from the
 * driver (toward the far end of the field), no matter which way the robot is facing. To do this,
 * we read the robot's heading from the Control Hub's IMU and rotate the joystick vector by the
 * opposite of that heading before feeding it into the mecanum wheel equations.
 *
 * Press OPTIONS on gamepad1 to re-zero the heading. Do this with the robot's front facing away
 * from the driver (the same way it started).
 *
 * The launcher uses closed-loop velocity control ("RUN_USING_ENCODER") with custom PIDF
 * coefficients, since a launcher wheel behaves very differently from most other FTC mechanisms.
